# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+ (backend), React Native (frontend PWA)
**Primary Dependencies**: Tokio (async runtime), SQLite (storage), React Native PWA framework
**Storage**: SQLite database for easy deployment
**Testing**: cargo test (backend), Jest/React Testing Library (frontend)
**Target Platform**: Linux server (backend), Web PWA (frontend), iOS/Android (via React Native)
**Project Type**: Web application with PWA frontend and Rust backend
**Performance Goals**: Sub-100ms UI interactions, <200ms API responses, 50+ concurrent timer sessions
**Constraints**: <200ms API p95, <100MB memory usage, offline-capable with local state persistence, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
**Scale/Scope**: Individual users with multi-device synchronization, single binary deployment

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Code Quality Excellence**: Implementation must follow idiomatic Rust patterns, pass clippy with zero warnings, and include clear documentation for complex logic.

**Test-First Development**: All features must have comprehensive tests written before implementation. Backend requires unit and integration tests. Frontend requires component tests for all interactions.

**User Experience Consistency**: Must provide consistent UI/UX across all platforms with real-time synchronization and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance.

**Performance Requirements**: UI interactions <100ms, API responses <200ms, graceful handling of network interruptions with local persistence.

**Simplicity Focus**: Features must align with core pomodoro timer functionality. Avoid scope creep. Maintain minimal technology stack.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

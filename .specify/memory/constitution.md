# Roma Timer Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence
All code must maintain high standards of readability, maintainability, and performance. Rust backend must follow idiomatic patterns and pass clippy lints with zero warnings. React Native frontend must follow ESLint rules consistently. Complex logic must be documented with clear comments and examples.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-Driven Development is mandatory for all features. Tests must be written before implementation, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Backend Rust code requires comprehensive unit and integration tests. Frontend React Native components must have Jest/React Testing Library coverage for all user interactions and state changes.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The application must provide a consistent, intuitive experience across all platforms (web PWA, mobile, desktop). UI components must follow established design patterns with responsive layouts. Timer state must be synchronized in real-time across all connected devices with minimal latency. Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) must be met for inclusive usage.

### IV. Performance and Reliability
The timer must be highly responsive with sub-100ms UI interactions. Backend API responses must complete within 200ms for all timer operations. The application must handle network interruptions gracefully with local state persistence. Memory usage must stay within reasonable bounds for long-running sessions on mobile devices.

### V. Simplicity and Single-Purpose Focus
Features must align with the core pomodoro timer functionality. Avoid scope creep into unrelated productivity tools. Configuration options should be intuitive and limited to essential timer settings. The technology stack must remain minimal: Rust backend, React Native PWA frontend, SQLite storage, containerized deployment.

## Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements
- Backend: Minimum 90% code coverage with integration tests for API endpoints
- Frontend: Component tests for all interactive elements, E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance: Load tests supporting 50+ concurrent timer sessions
- Security: Authentication tests for shared-secret mechanism and input validation

### Code Review Process
All pull requests require at least one approval from a maintainer. Automated checks must pass: linting, tests, build verification. Reviews must verify compliance with this constitution. Breaking changes require explicit justification and migration documentation.

### Documentation Standards
API endpoints must be documented with OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. Component props and state management must be documented with JSDoc comments. Deployment instructions must be kept current with docker-compose examples.

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development
1. Create specification document following template
2. Design implementation plan with task breakdown
3. Write tests for core functionality
4. Implement feature with test-first approach
5. Verify cross-platform compatibility
6. Update documentation and deployment guides

### Release Process
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) strictly followed
- CHANGELOG.md must document all user-visible changes
- Container images must be tagged with version numbers
- Release candidates tested in staging environment before production

### Maintenance and Support
- Security vulnerabilities patched within 7 days of disclosure
- Performance regressions addressed with high priority
- User feedback reviewed and prioritized within sprint planning
- Technical debt tracked and addressed in dedicated maintenance sprints

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Amendments require documented proposal, maintainer approval, and migration plan for existing code. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complex architectural decisions must be justified with written rationale referencing these principles.

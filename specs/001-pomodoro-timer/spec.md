# Feature Specification: Roma Timer Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-pomodoro-timer`
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application as described in @README.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Pomodoro Timer Control (Priority: P1)

A user needs to start, pause, and reset a pomodoro timer with work sessions and breaks. The timer should display countdown and automatically transition between work and break periods.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers immediate value and forms the foundation of the entire application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by operating the timer controls and verifying accurate countdown and state transitions, delivering a functional pomodoro experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the timer is stopped, **When** the user presses play, **Then** the timer starts counting down from the configured work duration
2. **Given** the timer is running, **When** the user presses pause, **Then** the timer stops at the current time and can be resumed
3. **Given** the timer is running or paused, **When** the user presses reset, **Then** the timer stops and returns to the initial work duration
4. **Given** a work session completes, **When** the countdown reaches zero, **Then** the timer automatically starts a short break session
5. **Given** the configured number of work sessions complete, **When** the last work session ends, **Then** the timer starts a long break session

### User Story 2 - Cross-Device Synchronization (Priority: P1)

A user starts a timer on their PC and needs to see the same timer state and receive notifications on their phone through the PWA.

**Why this priority**: This is the key differentiator that enables the multi-device productivity workflow described in the README.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a timer on one device, opening the application on another device, and verifying the timer state is synchronized in real-time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a timer is running on device A, **When** the user opens the app on device B, **Then** device B shows the exact same countdown and state
2. **Given** a timer is paused on device A, **When** the user presses play on device B, **Then** the timer resumes and both devices show the running state
3. **Given** a timer session completes, **When** notifications are enabled, **Then** all connected devices receive the completion notification
4. **Given** network connectivity is lost on one device, **When** connectivity is restored, **Then** the device synchronizes to the current timer state

---

### User Story 3 - Timer Configuration (Priority: P2)

A user needs to customize work and break durations, specify when long breaks occur, and configure notification preferences.

**Why this priority**: Essential for personalized productivity workflows and user retention, but secondary to basic timer functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by modifying settings and verifying the timer uses the new configurations in subsequent sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user accesses settings, **When** they modify work duration, **Then** the next work session uses the new duration
2. **Given** the user sets long break after 4 work sessions, **When** 4 work sessions complete, **Then** a long break begins instead of a short break
3. **Given** notifications are enabled, **When** a timer session ends, **Then** the user receives a notification
4. **Given** a notification webhook is configured, **When** a timer session ends, **Then** a webhook call is made to the specified URL
5. **Given** "wait for user interaction" is enabled, **When** a timer session ends, **Then** the next session doesn't start until user presses play

---

### User Story 4 - Theme Selection (Priority: P3)

A user needs to switch between light and dark modes based on their preference or environment.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience and accessibility but doesn't impact core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by switching themes and verifying the UI updates appropriately across all screens.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user selects dark mode, **When** the settings are saved, **Then** all UI elements use the dark color scheme
2. **Given** the user selects light mode, **When** the settings are saved, **Then** all UI elements use the light color scheme
3. **Given** the theme is changed, **When** the user navigates between screens, **Then** the selected theme persists

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the application is closed during an active timer session?
- How does system handle browser tab becoming inactive during timer operation?
- What happens when multiple devices try to control the timer simultaneously?
- How does system handle invalid webhook URLs or notification delivery failures?

# Specification Quality Checklist: Roma Timer Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [Roma Timer Application](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

âœ… All validation items passed. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase (/speckit.plan).

Key strengths identified:
- 4 well-defined user stories with clear priorities (P1: Timer control & sync, P2: Configuration, P3: Themes)
- 29 comprehensive functional requirements covering all aspects from timer controls to notifications
- Clear success criteria with measurable outcomes (10-second launch, 500ms sync, 95% reliability)
- Comprehensive performance, accessibility, and testing requirements aligned with constitution
- Edge cases properly identified for network interruptions and concurrent device access

The specification provides a solid foundation for implementation while maintaining focus on user value and avoiding implementation details.

# Tasks: Roma Timer Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-pomodoro-timer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are MANDATORY based on Roma Timer constitution requirements for comprehensive testing.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume web application structure based on plan.md

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are GENERATED TASKS based on the Roma Timer specification.

  Tasks are organized by user story to enable:
  - Independent implementation and testing of each story
  - MVP delivery after P1 stories (Basic Timer Control + Cross-Device Sync)
  - Incremental delivery with configuration (P2) and themes (P3)

  All tasks follow the checklist format: - [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
  ============================================================================

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 & 2 (P1): Can proceed in parallel after Phase 2 - Core MVP functionality
  - User Story 3 (P2): Depends on Stories 1 & 2 - Configuration features
  - User Story 4 (P3): Can proceed independently after Phase 2 - Theme features
- **Notification System (Phase 7)**: Depends on Stories 1 & 2 - Cross-cutting feature
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (Basic Timer Control)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Cross-Device Sync)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances Story 1 but can be developed independently
- **User Story 3 (Timer Configuration)**: Depends on Stories 1 & 2 being functional - Builds upon core timer functionality
- **User Story 4 (Theme Selection)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent UI enhancement

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints/components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1 & 2 can start in parallel
- User Story 4 (Themes) can be developed in parallel with Stories 1 & 2
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (MVP)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for TimerSession model in backend/tests/unit/test_timer_session.rs"
Task: "Unit test for timer control logic in backend/tests/unit/test_timer_service.rs"
Task: "Integration test for timer API endpoints in backend/tests/integration/test_timer_api.rs"
Task: "Component test for TimerDisplay component in frontend/src/components/TimerDisplay/__tests__/TimerDisplay.test.tsx"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create TimerSession model in backend/src/models/timer_session.rs"
Task: "Create TimerSession TypeScript interface in frontend/src/types/index.ts"
Task: "Create useTimer hook for timer state management in frontend/src/hooks/useTimer.ts"

# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create TimerDisplay component with countdown in frontend/src/components/TimerDisplay/TimerDisplay.tsx"
Task: "Create TimerControls component with play/pause buttons in frontend/src/components/TimerControls/TimerControls.tsx"
Task: "Create TimerScreen with timer display and controls in frontend/src/pages/TimerScreen.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic Timer Control)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Cross-Device Sync)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both stories independently and together
6. Deploy/demo core MVP functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Basic MVP)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently + integration ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Complete MVP)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently + integration ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Enhanced MVP)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently + integration ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Polished MVP)
6. Complete Notification System & Polish ‚Üí Final release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Timer Control)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Synchronization)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Themes) - can start early as it's independent
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Developer A/B: User Story 3 (Configuration) - needs Stories 1 & 2 functional
5. All developers: Polish & testing phase

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach per constitution)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Total tasks: 122
- P1 (MVP) tasks: 48 (Stories 1 & 2)
- P2 tasks: 21 (Story 3 + Notifications)
- P3 tasks: 14 (Story 4)
- Polish tasks: 13 (Final phase)
- Parallel opportunities identified throughout for team acceleration
